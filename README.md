# python-challenge

Contributor: Thomas Keene

Overview:
In this assignment, I completed two Python challenges (PyBank and PyPoll) and also gained experience using GitHub.

PyBank Challenge:
For this challenge, I created a Python script to analyze financial records to calculate each of the following values:
The total number of months included in the dataset
The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

PyPoll Challenge:
For this challenge, I created a Python script to analyze election records to calculate each of the following values:
The total number of votes cast
A complete list of candidates who received votes
The percentage of votes each candidate won
The total number of votes each candidate won
The winner of the election based on popular vote
